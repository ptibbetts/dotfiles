These are the dotfiles I use for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), 
[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
as well as a global config file for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

There's no installation script, that's done by 
[my macOS Ansible script](https://github.com/ptibbetts/macOS) 
which installs [Oh My Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) 
(so that the .zshrc file will actually work) as well as any Vim plugins.
